Project Name: MITHIWEAR shoe store
Author: Martin Gathitu Mithi
Description:
  -The aforementioned project is a single webpage of a shoe store containing a variety of brands.
  -The webpage is interactive as one can filter the shoes based on brand name as well as searching for a shoe.
  -A user has the ability to add items to cart, purchase or remove items from cart.
  -The project uses an online API which i have managed to host on my github page.
  -Each shoe item has a description, price and an image of the specific shoe.
  -The webpage is also responsive as the grid shoe items automatically align depending on the device's width.
  -All in all the project meets my MVP specifications.
